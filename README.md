# Foundations of Reliable Cooperation under Asynchrony, Byzantine Faults, and Message Adversaries

This repository hosts the source code of my PhD thesis, written entirely in [Typst](https://typst.app/) (correct compilation is only guaranteed for **Typst v0.13**).

[The compiled PDF of the PhD thesis can be found on HAL.](https://inria.hal.science/tel-04764046)

For this thesis, I also developed my own Typst package for writing algorithms, called **Algol**, which can be found at `/setup/algo.typ`.
