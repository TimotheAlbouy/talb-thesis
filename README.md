# Foundations of Reliable Cooperation under Asynchrony, Byzantine Faults, and Message Adversaries

This repository hosts the source code of my PhD thesis, written entirely in [Typst](https://typst.app/).

Correct compilation is only guaranteed for **Typst v0.13**.

For this thesis, I also developed my own Typst package for writing algorithms, called **Algol**, which can be found at `/setup/algo.typ`.
